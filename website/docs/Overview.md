_One Nation - Let's talk commerce_

Here is our thought process

_If we need to solve the adoption problem we need to communicate in a language closer to our hearts - and what better than our native languages to do so._

Local language support mainly intends to fetch the content in the native language of the users enhancing the user experience and showing the content that is more relevant to the question posed by the user.

## Vision

The vision is to aid the organizations to increase their customer base and at the same time make the product user friendly so that a native user can ask the services/products they want in their native language and the system recognises and fetches the data user is looking for and the data will be available in the native language

## Capabilities

Here are a few major capabilities we envision in the future:

**Medium term:**

- Make this available as an Open-Source framework that can be plugged and used depending on use cases - to bring Conversational commerce truly to lifeAuto language detection - that would take away the language selection requirementBuild performance optimization frameworks, to enable superior experience even with low bandwidth.

**Long term:**

- Decouple the Database from the NLP Engine - So the NLP Engine does what it says on the box - Understand intentBuild a Trainer function - for effectively training the Business context module for new additionsTake away base language dependency
