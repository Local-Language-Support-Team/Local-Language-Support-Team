## The Thought

_One Nation - Let's talk commerce! Speak your language._

_If we need to solve the adoption problem we need to communicate in a language closer to our hearts and what better than our native languages to do so. And that's the idea behind Conversational Commerce._

Local language support mainly intends to fetch the content in the native language of the users enhancing the user experience and showing the content that is more relevant to the question posed by the user in the same native language the request was made.

## The Vision

Make commerce accessible to everyone by enabling organizations to reach a wider customer base where we provide the capability of being able to request for services and products via their native language.

## The Capabilities

**Medium term:**

- Provide this solution as an Open-Source framework that can be integrated seamlessly to any application.
- Auto language detection to take away the language selection requirement.
- Build performance optimization frameworks to enable superior experience even with low bandwidth.

**Long term:**

- Decouple the database from the NLP Engine, so it does what it says on the box. Understanding the intent.
- Build a trainer function for effectively training the business context module for new additions.
- Take away base language dependency.
